# Archive Reader

A simple and safe archive reader focused on understanding and exploring compressed files.

Initially, this project started as a file organizer.  
It was later restructured to focus on reading and exploring `.zip` and `.7z` archives.

## Previous Scope
- Dry-run mode (no files were moved)
- Extension-based classification rules
- Directory scanning and logging

## Current Features
- Read and list contents of `.zip` files
- Safe inspection without automatic extraction

## Planned Features
- Support for `.7z` archives
- Optional extraction
- Virtual directory navigation

## Status
Early development (v0.1)
